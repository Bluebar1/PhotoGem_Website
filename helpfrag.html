            >PhotoGem provides a flexible environment for viewing your photos in
            context with location, photo properties, and audio. It works with
            the Photo Albums you set up in the Apple Photos App. As you page
            through, it presents a configurable collection of “segments” below
            each photo. The Map segment includes several links that allow you to
            explore the Photos location with other apps, including integration
            with Google Street View (via Google Maps) and Wikipedia.

            While viewing a photo image, tap on the Map segment to bring up the

          <span class="bullet">
            Search for a place by tapping in the search field on the top
          </span>

            Press on the map at a location where you would like to “drop a pin”.
            Once the change is saved, it will be the GPS location for the photo.

          <span class="bullet">
            Touch a pin if you would like to delete a GPS Coordinate
          </span>
          <span class="bullet">
            Increase or Decrease the Image Direction. The Image Direction is the
            angle that the camera was pointing when the photo was taken, with 0°
            being true North, 90° True East, and so on. It is used to give
            additional context for the photo’s object, as well as the initial
            frame for Google Street View.
          </span>
          <span class="bullet">
            Change the Map Type - Standard / Hybrid / Satellite . This change is
            also reflected in the Map Segment after the “Photo Location” panel
            is closed.
          </span>
          <span class="bullet">
            Zoom in or out using the standard 2 finger gestures. Changes are
            also reflected in the Map Segment after the “Photo Location” panel
            is closed.

          <span class="bullet">
            Link to another App - The primary purpose of having the links here
            is so you can quickly “test” what Google Street View will look like

            committing the change(s).

            You can associate Audio Clips with photos. Note that it’s an
            association and not stored as part the photo.
          </span>
          <span>
            First make sure the “Audio Clip” segment is configured to display
            (see “How to rearrange the view”)

          <span>
            The first time you try to create a clip you are given a choice
            between saving them on the iPhone or in your iCloud. It’s preferred
            to store them in iCloud for 2 reasons. First, if they are saved in
            iCloud and the PhotoGem app is deleted, the audio clips will not be
            deleted also. Second, if the Audio Clips are saved in the cloud then
            other devices using PhotoGem with the same iCloud will be able to
            share the clips. This choice can be changed in PhotoGem Settings (⚙)
          </span>
          <span>
            You can create a clip by simply hitting the red record button or
            browse for a file by tapping the ellipsis (⋯) that’s on the bottom
            right of the Audio Clip Segment.
          </span>
          <span>
            PhotoGem Settings also allow you to enable a “AutoPlay” mode where
            the clip will automatically start playing as soon as the Photo is
            viewed.

            segment?”. If Google has not captured Street View images at that
